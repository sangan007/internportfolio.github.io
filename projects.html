                <h2>Task 1:<a href="https://github.com/sangan007/Auth-system">Auth-System</a></h2>
                <p>SecureAuth is a robust and scalable user authentication system designed to handle secure registration and login processes. Built with an emphasis on security and efficiency, this system ensures that user data is protected through secure password hashing and authentication protocols.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User Registration: Seamlessly register users with email and password validation.</li>
                    <li>User Login: Secure login process with hashed passwords and token-based authentication (JWT or session tokens).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project serves as a foundation for developers to build more advanced-level authentication features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), or third-party OAuth integrations.</p>

                <p>Task-manager is a robust Task Management API designed to facilitate the efficient handling of tasks for users. The application enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks seamlessly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>API Endpoints: Allow users to add, retrieve, modify, and delete tasks effortlessly.</li>
                    <li>Database Integration: A simple yet effective database schema has been established to store task information.</li>
                    <li>Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms provide meaningful feedback for invalid requests.</li>
                    <li>Optional Enhancements: Features such as timestamps for task creation and updates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By implementing basic authentication, TaskMaster not only secures user data but also provides a foundation for future enhancements, making it a scalable solution for managing tasks efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Task 3:<a href="https://github.com/sangan007/book-manager">Book-Manager</a></h2>
                <p>Book-Manager is a robust Book Management API designed to facilitate the efficient handling of Books for users. </p>
                <ul>
                    The objective of this task is to develop a Simple RESTful API for managing a list of books, enabling users to perform CRUD operations effectively. This API will serve as a foundation for any application that requires book management functionality, promoting organized data handling and accessibility. The project involves implementing essential API endpoints, including GET /books to retrieve a list of all books, GET /books/
to fetch details of a specific book, POST /books to add new books with attributes such as title, author, and publication year, PUT /books/
to update existing book details, and DELETE /books/
to remove books from the collection. The database model will include fields for the book's title, author, and year. Testing will be conducted using Postman to ensure each route functions correctly, returning the expected responses. Additionally, optional features may include basic validation for required fields and error handling for invalid requests. This task provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen back-end development skills while creating a practical application for efficiently managing book collections.

                        <p>The Movie Scraper is a powerful tool developed using Golang that automates the extraction of movie data from various online sources. This application efficiently collects key information, such as titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and summaries, from multiple websites. By leveraging Golang's concurrency features, the scraper optimizes performance, allowing for faster data retrieval and processing. This project not only showcases my skills in web scraping and data manipulation but also emphasizes my ability to create efficient solutions for gathering and organizing information from diverse online platforms. The Movie Scraper serves as a foundational tool for further data analysis and can be easily extended to include additional features like data storage and integration with front-end applications.</p>
